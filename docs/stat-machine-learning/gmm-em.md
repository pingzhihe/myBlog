## Gaussian Mixture Models
A probabilistic view of clustering. Simple example of a latent variable model.

**Modelling uncertainty in data clustering**

k-means clustering assigns each point to exactly one cluster

- Like k-means, a probabilistic mixture model requires the user to choose the **number of clusters** in advance

- Unlike k-means, the probabilistic model grants us power to **express uncertainly about the origin** of each point
