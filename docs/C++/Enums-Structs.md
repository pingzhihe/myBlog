# Enums and Structs

We can define a new name for an existing type.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

using Length = int; // define a type alias with identifier 'length'

int main()
{
    Length x { 5 }; // we can use 'length' here since we defined it above
    std::cout << x << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

C++ can allow us to crearte entirely new, custom types for use in our programs! Such types are often called **user-defined types** or **programmer-defined types**.
C++ has two different categories of compound types that can be used to create program-defined types:
- Enumerate types (including unscoped and scoped enumerations)
- Class types (including structs, classes and unions)

### Define program-defined types
Just like type aliases, program-defined types must be defined before they can be used. The defination for a program-defined type is called a **type-defination**.

Example:
```cpp
// Define a program-defined type named Fraction so the compiler understands what a Fraction is
// (we'll explain what a struct is and how to use them later in this chapter)
// This only defines what a Fraction type looks like, it doesn't create one
struct Fraction
{
	int numerator {};
	int denominator {};
};

// Now we can make use of our Fraction type
int main()
{
	Fraction f { 3, 4 }; // this actually instantiates a Fraction object named f

	return 0;
}
```
In this example, we're using the `struct` keyword to define a new program-defined type named `Fraction`(in the global scope, can be used in anywhere in rest of this file).

## Naming program-defined types
By convention, program-defined types are named starting with a captial letter and don't use a suffifx(e.g. `Fraction`, not `fraction`, `fraction_t`, or `Fraction_t`), and then an optional initializer. Because C++ is case-sensitive, there is no naming conflict here!

### Using program-defined types throuthout a multi-file program

:::tip

**Best practice**:
- A program-defined type used in only one code file should be defined in that code file as close to the first point of use as possible.
- A program-defined type used in multiple code files should be defined in a *header file* with the same name as the program-defined type and then `#included` into each code file as needed.

:::

Example:
`Fraction.h`
```cpp
#ifndef FRACTION_H
#define FRACTION_H

// Define a new type named Fraction
// This only defines what a Fraction looks like, it doesn't create one
// Note that this is a full definition, not a forward declaration
struct Fraction
{
	int numerator {};
	int denominator {};
};

#endif
```
`Fraction.cpp`
```cpp
#include "Fraction.h" // include our Fraction definition in this code file

// Now we can make use of our Fraction type
int main()
{
	Fraction f{ 3, 4 }; // this actually creates a Fraction object named f

	return 0;
}
```

## Enumerations
An **enumeration** is a compound data type whose values are restricted to a set of named symbolic constants (called **enumerators**).

Unscoped enumerations are defined via the `enum` keyword.
```cpp
// Define a new unscoped enumeration named Color
enum Color
{
    // Here are the enumerators
    // These symbolic constants define all the possible values this type can hold
    // Each enumerator is separated by a comma, not a semicolon
    red,
    green,
    blue, // trailing comma optional but recommended
}; // the enum definition must end with a semicolon

int main()
{
    // Define a few variables of enumerated type Color
    Color apple { red };   // my apple is red
    Color shirt { green }; // my shirt is green
    Color cup { blue };    // my cup is blue

    Color socks { white }; // error: white is not an enumerator of Color
    Color hat { 2 };       // error: 2 is not an enumerator of Color

    return 0;
}
```

### Scoped enumerations
Scoped enumerations won't convert to integers implicitly, and the enumerators *only* placed into the scope region of the enumeration.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    enum class Color // "enum class" defines this as a scoped enumeration rather than an unscoped enumeration
    {
        red, // red is considered part of Color's scope region
        blue,
    };

    enum class Fruit
    {
        banana, // banana is considered part of Fruit's scope region
        apple,
    };

    Color color { Color::red }; // note: red is not directly accessible, we have to use Color::red
    Fruit fruit { Fruit::banana }; // note: banana is not directly accessible, we have to use Fruit::banana

    if (color == fruit) // compile error: the compiler doesn't know how to compare different types Color and Fruit
        std::cout << "color and fruit are equal\n";
    else
        std::cout << "color and fruit are not equal\n";

    return 0;
}
```
### Scoped enmuneration define their own scope regions
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    enum class Color // "enum class" defines this as a scoped enum rather than an unscoped enum
    {
        red, // red is considered part of Color's scope region
        blue,
    };

    std::cout << red << '\n';        // compile error: red not defined in this scope region
    std::cout << Color::red << '\n'; // compile error: std::cout doesn't know how to print this (will not implicitly convert to int)

    Color color { Color::blue }; // okay

    return 0;
}
```
:::tip
**Best practice**:
Favor scoped enumerations over unscoped enumerations unless thereâ€™s a compelling reason to do otherwise.

## Structs, members and member selection
```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Employee
{
    int id {};
    int age {};
    double wage {};
};

int main()
{
    Employee joe {};

    joe.age = 32;  // use member selection operator (.) to select the age member of variable joe

    std::cout << joe.age << '\n'; // print joe's age

    return 0;
}
```
