## 1.Deutsch's Algorithm
### problem statemet
- Given a function $f: \{0,1\} \to \{0,1\}$ as a black box

- Worst-case complexity: 2 function evaluations

### Quantum Solution
- Uses quantum superposition to evaluate both inputs simultaneously
- Achieves result in one function evaluation

### Key concepts

### Algorithm Steps
1. Prepare initial state $\ket{01}$
2. Apply Hadamard gates to both qubits
3. Apply the quantum oracle $U_{f}$

# Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGAN)
## Classcial Generative Adversrial Networks
### Overview
- An exciting development in Deep Learning research
- Various applications: Image generation, super-resolution, image-to-image translation, 3D object generation, text generatin, synthetic data generation

### Key Compnents 
1. Generator (G)
    - Creates new sample data from a specific domain (e.g., images, text, audio)
    - Aims to produce "fake" data indistinguishable from real data

2. Discriminator (D)
    - Distinguishes fake data created by the Generator from real data

### Training Strategy
- Using game theory
- Analogy: Generator as a counterfeiter, Distriminator as a detective
- Both try to outsmart each other

### Mathematical Framework
- Real-world data distribution: $p_R(x)$
- Generator distribution: $p_G(x)$
- Genweator parameters: $\theta_G$
- Discriminator parameters: $\theta_D$
- Objective: Maximize the probability of D misclassifying G's samples as real

## Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks
### Motvation
- Potential to solve certain hard problems that classical GANs struggle with
- Applications in quantum chemistry calculations and simulations

### Key Concepts
1. Quantum Generator (QG)
    - Implemented as a variational quantum circuit
    - Parameters: $\theta_G$
    - Output: Density matrix $\rho_{\text{G}}^{\lambda}$
2. Quantum Discriminator (QD)
    - Separate quantum circuit
    - Parameter: $\theta_D$
    - Determines if input state is created by R (real) or G (fake)
3. Data Source (R)
    - Outputs a density martix $\rho_{\text{G}}^{\lambda}$ ciontainning n subsystems
4. Noise Source($\ket{z}$)
    - Provides entropy within the distribution of generatied data
    - Acts as a control for the generator

### QGAN Framework
- Conditional GANs: Generate samples from condiional distribution $p(x|\lambda)$
- Labels: $\ket{\lambda}$
- Generator output:  $\rho_{\text{G}}^{\lambda}(\theta_G, z) = \ket{\psi_z} \bra{\psi_z}$ for each $\lambda$ and $\ket{z}$

### Optimization Objective
- Formalized as minmax adversarial game:
$
\underset{\theta_G}{\min} \, \underset{\theta_D}{\max} \, V(\theta_D, \theta_G)
$
- Cost function is linear in the output probabilities of D

### QGAN Circuit
- 6 operationally defined registers
- $Z \equiv \ket{real} \bra{real} - \ket{fake}\bra{fake}$

### Trainning Procedure
1. Initialize $\theta_G$ and $\theta_D$ randomly
2. For each training iteration :
    - Sample minibatch of n noise samples and m label samples
    - Generate m fake dara samples using G
    - Update D by ascending its stochastic gradient
    - Sample minibatch of m noise samples and m label samples
    - Update G by descending its stochastic gradient

## Key Takeways
1. QGANs extend classical GANs to the quantum domain, potentially solving problems classical GANs strugglew with.
2. The quantum framework uses density matrices and quantum circuits for both the generator and discriminator.
3. The training process involves a minmax game between the quantum generator and discriminator
4. QGAN have potential applications in quantum chemistry and quantum simulations.
5. The noisee source $\ket{z}$ play a crucial role in providing entropy and control for the quantum generator.
